# Cash-loan-risk-tolerance-of-tail-customer-group-according-to-lifetime-value
Background: Tail customers whose DPD7+ amount rate （MOB1） is within 12%-32% are selected, and LTV calculation is carried out considering the annual capital cost of 24% to find out the break-even point of risk tolerance.

Cost of capital = （DPD0-7） *24%* days /360
Conclusion:  when DPD7+ amount rate（MOB1） is about 19.64%, the 30-day LTV is negative, and the 60-120 day LTV is positive. LTV is negative within 120 days when the risk reaches about 22%. Therefore, considering LTV, the tail risk tolerance is about 19.64%(DPD7+ amount rate of MOB1).

Verification: In terms of a 30-day cycle of customer group, when the tail risk is around 20% ( MOB1 DPD7+ amount rate), the LTV>=60 days is positive when considering the cost of capital, so the risk of around 20% ( MOB1 DPD7+ amount rate) is acceptable.
